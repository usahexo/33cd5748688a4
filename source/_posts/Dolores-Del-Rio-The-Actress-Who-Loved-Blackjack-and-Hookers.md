#  Dolores Del Rio: The Actress Who Loved Blackjack and Hookers

Dolores Del Rio was a beautiful actress who starred in many Hollywood films during the 1920s and 1930s. She quickly became one of the highest-paid and most popular stars in America, but she was also known for her vices. Dolores loved blackjack and hookers, and she was often spotted at casinos and brothels.

Dolores was born on August 3, 1905, in San Francisco, California. Her father was a Mexican diplomat, and her mother was from a wealthy Spanish family.

Dolores quickly became one of Hollywood's most sought-after actresses, starring in films such as "What Price Glory?" (1926), "The Littlest Rebel" (1935), and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1936).

Despite her success, Dolores was known for her wild lifestyle. She loved gambling and often lost large sums of money at blackjack tables. She was also a regular at brothels, where she would enjoy sex with prostitutes. In fact, when MGM conducted screen tests for its new starlets in 1935, one of the questions they asked each girl was: "What do you think of Mrs. Del Rio's morals?"

Dolores' wild lifestyle caused many problems with her marriages. In 1926, she married actor Reggie REad; however, the marriage ended in divorce just two years later. She then married actor Lew Ayres; but that marriage also ended in divorce after just four years. In 1940, Dolores married Orson Welles; but that marriage lasted just four months.

Despite her personal troubles, Dolores continued to be one of Hollywood's top stars throughout the 1930s. She retired from acting in 1947 and moved to Mexico City. There she started a successful career as a television producer. Dolores died from lung cancer on September 11, 1983, at the age of 78.
