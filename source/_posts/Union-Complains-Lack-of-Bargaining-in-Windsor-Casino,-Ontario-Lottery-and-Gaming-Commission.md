#  Union Complains Lack of Bargaining in Windsor Casino, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission

The Union representing workers at the Windsor Casino in Ontario is filing a grievance, complaining about the lack of bargaining that has taken place between the casino and its workforce.

The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission, who license and oversee casinos in the province, say that they are not involved in the bargaining process between the casino and its workers.

"The OLG has no role in the collective bargaining process," said spokesperson Deborah Jones. "We are confident that the parties will reach an agreement that is in the best interests of both employees and the casino."

The Union representing workers at Windsor Casino says that they were not given sufficient notice of changes that would be taking place at the casino, including job losses. They also claim that their members have been forced to take pay cuts.

In a statement, Unifor Local 444 says that it "remains hopeful that our employer will come to the bargaining table with a serious offer that contentiously meets the needs of our members."

#  Windsor Casino, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission Continue without Union Bargaining

Windsor Casino and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission are continuing to operate without a union contract. The Windsor Star reports that the OLG says it has reached agreements with its employees who are represented by Unifor, the largest private-sector union in Canada.

The casino is now being operated by supervisors, managers, and non-unionized staff members. Unifor Local 444 president Dino Chiodo said that Windsor Casino is the only property in Ontario without a collective agreement.

"We've actually made some offers that have been pretty much rejected out of hand," Chiodo told The Windsor Star. "It would appear they're going to try to ram this down our throats."

Ontario Lottery and Gaming spokeswoman Christine Cordy said that the commission has reached agreements with all affected unions at its other properties, except for Windsor. "We've been in negotiations with Local 444 for quite some time and we remain at the table," she said.

Cordy added that the commission offered employees at Windsor Casino a wage increase of 3 per cent in each of the first two years of a four-year deal, followed by a 2 per cent increase in the last two years. Chiodo told The Windsor Star that his members want 4 per cent in each year of a four-year deal.

Unifor represents about 1,500 workers at Windsor Casino. The union has set up a picket line outside of the casino since it went on strike on October 14th.

#  Union Absent from Windsor Casino Bargaining, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission

The Windsor Star has reported that the Union representing workers at the Casino in Windsor has not been participating in recent bargaining with the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. They are seeking more job security, stating that there is an increased demand for part-time work due to automation.

In a statement, Unifor national representative Steve Toms said "We've put proposals on the table to secure our members' jobs and protect their pensions, but OLG is not interested." While he would not disclose what the specific proposals were, he did say that they were "reasonable."

The lack of participation from the Union is confounding, as jobs at the Casino are in high demand. It is possible that the OLG may be seeking to outsource some of these jobs to cheaper labor markets. This could have a devastating effect on the workers in Windsor who have relied on these jobs for years.

#  Union Negotiations Left Out of Windsor Casino, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission Talks

The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission has been in closed-door talks about the future of Windsor’s casino with no mention of union negotiations. This has some concerned that the commission is not interested in negotiating a fair contract for the workers.

Unifor, which represents the casino workers, worries that the commission is planning to move the casino away from Windsor or sell it off to a private operator. The commission has not commented on these concerns.

Windsor’s casino is currently undergoing a major renovation, which is set to be completed in 2020. The commission has not said whether or not the renovation will go ahead if a new contract cannot be negotiated.

Workers at Windsor’s casino are currently paid $11 an hour, while workers at casinos in other cities make $14 an hour. Unifor is asking for wages of $15 an hour.

#  No Union Representation in Windsor Casino, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Commission Bargaining

The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) is the government agency responsible for gambling in the province of Ontario. The OLG has been bargaining with Unifor, the largest private-sector union in Canada, for a new collective agreement covering over 1,500 casino workers in Windsor. However, Unifor has announced that it is withdrawing from the negotiations, accusing the OLG of refusing to bargain in good faith.

Unifor has been seeking improvements to wages and benefits for its members at the OLG’s Windsor casinos. However, the OLG says that it is unable to meet all of Unifor’s demands and has offered a contract that would increase wages by 2.5 per cent over four years. Unifor says that this offer is inadequate and has instead demanded increases of between eight and 10 per cent.

The OLG has argued that it cannot afford to meet all of Unifor’s demands, as its financial position has deteriorated in recent years. In a press release, the OLG stated that, “given our current fiscal situation and the challenging economic environment we are operating in, it is not possible for us to meet all of Unifor’s asks.”

Unifor has accused the OLG of refusing to bargain in good faith and has therefore decided to withdraw from negotiations. In a statement released on behalf of the bargaining committee, Unifor National President Jerry Dias said: “The refusal by the OLG to bargain meaningfully leaves us no choice but to conclude that they are not serious about reaching an agreement. Our members have been clear – they want a fair deal and they are not going to let this corporation walk all over them.”

It remains unclear what will happen next in negotiations between the OLG and Unifor. The previous collective agreement expired on March 31st and without a new agreement in place, there is a risk that casino workers could go on strike.
