In 1829, in Austria poker was popular. It is not only the game of cards but also betting. There are a lot of people like to join the game, so how many cards were used in this game?

The answer may be different according to different versions of poker, but typically a deck of 52 cards is used in poker. Sometimes, jokers are also used in the game and make the total number of cards 53 or 54. Different games may also need different numbers of cards.

# Poker Card Counting in 1829 Vienna

The idea of card counting is as old as poker itself. The first recorded example of card counting in a major poker game happened in Vienna, Austria in 1829.

Vienna was at the time a major center for games of chance, and poker was one of the most popular games. In 1829, a group of Frenchmen visiting Vienna took on a group of local players in a high stakes poker game. The Frenchmen were well known for their card counting techniques, and they used these techniques to win hand after hand against the Viennese players.

The locals were not used to being beaten at poker, and they soon began to complain that the Frenchmen were using unfair methods. The Frenchmen insisted that they were simply using good strategy, and they demonstrated how they were counting cards to ensure victory.

Despite the complaints from the locals, the Frenchmen continued to win hand after hand. They eventually walked away from the table with a large amount of money, much to the annoyance of the Viennese players.

# Playing Cards during 1829 Austrian Empire

The modern game of Poker is derived from a 16th century French game called poque, which in turn descended from an Arabic card game called As Nas. Poque was brought to the United States by French settlers and quickly gained in popularity. The first record of Poker being played in the United States comes from New Orleans in 1829.

At the time, Poker was played with a 20-card deck (A-K-Q-J-10). The 4 suits were Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Each player received 5 cards and betting took place before any cards were revealed. The object of the game was to make the best 5 card hand using any combination of 2 hole cards and 3 community cards.

The most popular variation of Poker at the time was Four-Card Monte, which is still popular today. In Four-Card Monte, players are given 4 cards face down and are asked to choose one. The dealer then reveals the fifth card, which is always the Queen of Spades. If the player selected the correct card, they win double their bet. If they selected the wrong card, they lose their bet.
