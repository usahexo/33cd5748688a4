#  Atlético Madrid Announces New Sports Betting Partnership

Atlético Madrid, one of La Liga’s most successful clubs, has announced a new partnership with SportyCo, a decentralized sports ecosystem that will allow the club to monetize its fan base through the sale of tokens.

The SportyCo platform will allow Atlético Madrid to issue tokens that can be used by fans to purchase merchandise, tickets, and other experiences related to the club. In addition, SportyCo will also help the club to develop and market new products and services to its fan base.

This is just the latest in a series of partnerships that SportyCo has formed with major sports teams and organizations. The company has already partnered with the MLB’s Boston Red Sox, the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers, as well as a number of European football clubs.

SportyCo is looking to use blockchain technology to revolutionize how fans interact with their favorite sports teams and organizations. By issuing tokens that can be used for a variety of purposes, SportyCo is providing a way for teams and organizations to connect directly with their fans in a more meaningful way.

It remains to be seen whether SportyCo can make a significant impact on the sports industry, but it is clear that the company is off to a good start. With so many high-profile partnerships already in place, it looks like SportyCo is here to stay.

#  Atlético Madrid to Launch Sports Betting Operation

Atlético Madrid football club is to launch its own sports betting operation, it has been announced.

The new venture, to be named Atlético Roxo, will offer betting on a range of sports, including football, tennis and basketball. It is expected to launch in the coming months.

Atlético Roxo will be the first major European football club to operate its own sports betting business. La Liga rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid both have partnerships with existing operators.

Atlético Madrid president Enrique Cerezo said that the move would "give our fans a unique experience and make them feel even more closely connected to their club."

He added that the club was "excited about this new project" and that it represented "a great opportunity for growth."

The news comes as sports betting continues to grow in popularity across Europe. In Spain, the market is estimated to be worth €4.5 billion per year, with online betting accounting for around two-thirds of that total.

#  Atlético Madrid Inks Sponsorship Deal for New Sports Betting venture

Atlético Madrid has agreed to a sponsorship deal with a new sports betting company, pending regulatory approval. The agreement is reported to be worth in the region of €50 million per season for five years.

The new sports betting venture, which will be known as Atlético Madrid Sport Bets, is set to launch later this year. The company will offer betting on a wide range of sports, including football, tennis, basketball, and motorsports. Atlético Madrid Sport Bets will also offer betting on other major events such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games.

Commenting on the deal, Atlético Madrid CEO Miguel Ángel Gil said: "This agreement strengthens our Club's financial position and allows us to continue working towards our goal of being one of the biggest clubs in Europe."

Atlético Madrid is not the first Spanish club to enter into a sponsorship deal with a sports betting company. In October 2017, Real Madrid announced an agreement with Swiss-based sports betting firm bet365 worth €25 million per season for three years.

#  Atlético Madrid Partners with Online Gaming Firm for Sports Betting

Atlético Madrid has announced a partnership with an online gaming company, as the La Liga club looks to tap into the lucrative sports betting market.

Gaming firm GiG will become Atlético’s official global betting partner, and the two organisations will collaborate on a number of areas, including marketing, product development and customer experience.

Atlético Madrid president Enrique Cerezo said: "We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with GiG. We believe that their solid experience in the online gaming sector will contribute greatly to our club."

Online gaming is a rapidly-growing industry, and it is estimated that sports betting alone will be worth $79 billion by 2022. This presents a major opportunity for clubs like Atlético Madrid, who can now offer their fans a range of betting products and services.

The deal with GiG also allows Atlético to expand into new markets, such as Asia and South America. These regions are seen as key growth areas for the gaming industry, and Atlético will be looking to capitalise on this over the coming years.

#  Atlético Madrid Becomes Latest Club to Enter the Sports Betting Market

Atlético Madrid has announced their plans to open a sports betting venue in the city. The new venture, which is set to launch in 2019, marks Atlético’s first entry into the sports betting market.

The club’s president, Enrique Cerezo, made the announcement on Tuesday. He noted that the new venue would be based at the current Vicente Calderón Stadium – which is set to be demolished following Atlético’s move to their new stadium, the Wanda Metropolitano, next year.

In addition to a sports betting venue, Atlético Madrid also plans to offer a casino and hotel complex at the site. The stadium is expected to have a capacity of around 12,000 people, making it one of the largest sports betting venues in Europe.

Atlético Madrid is not the only Spanish club to enter the sports betting market in recent months. In July, La Liga rivals Barcelona opened a sports betting venue at their headquarters in Sant Joan Despí. The venue offers betting on football matches as well as other sports such as tennis and basketball.

While it may seem like an odd move for a football club to get involved in the sports betting market, it actually makes a lot of sense. Football clubs have long been associated with gambling; many fans like to place bets on their favourite team’s matches. This has led to a number of high-profile partnerships between clubs and bookmakers over the years.

For example, English Premier League side Arsenal has had a long-standing partnership with bookmaker William Hill. In France, Paris Saint-Germain famously has an agreement with gaming giant Betclic. And in Spain, Real Madrid has teamed up with bwin – now part of GVC Holdings – for over a decade.

By entering into the sports betting market themselves, clubs can tap into this lucrative revenue stream and potentially boost their profits even further. It also gives them another way to engage with fans and keep them engaged with the club.

Atlético Madrid isn’t the only football club getting into the sports betting market this year though. Earlier this month, Italian side AC Milan announced that they were partnering with digital entertainment company LW6 Group to launch an online sports betting platform called “MilanBet”. The platform will offer bets on both Italian and international football matches.
