This offseason, the Oakland Athletics sought to bolster their pitching staff by signing free agent starter Scott Kazmir. The move signaled the intention of the A’s front office to make a serious run at the World Series in 2014.</p>
<p>Early in the season, it appeared that the Athletics’ investment in their pitching staff would pay off, as they found themselves in first place in their division by the All-Star break. However, a late-season slump saw them fall out of contention and they were ultimately eliminated from playoff contention on the final day of the regular season.</p>
<p>Despite this disappointing end to their season, the Athletics remain a team to be reckoned with in 2014. Led by their strong starting rotation, they are still one of the favorites to win the World Series. In order to place a bet on the Athletics winning it all, visit one of several online sportsbooks, such as BetOnline Sportsbook or Bovada Sportsbook.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, one of those same online sportsbooks is currently offering odds on whether or not Bitcoin will be accepted as payment for wagers on Oakland Athletics games during the upcoming MLB season. At this time, it is unclear if any other major league sports teams will allow Bitcoin to be used for betting on their games this year.</p>
<h1 id="Bitcoin-Jobbing-Athletics-Secure-Second-Place-in-the-AL-West"><a href="#Bitcoin-Jobbing-Athletics-Secure-Second-Place-in-the-AL-West" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin Jobbing Athletics Secure Second Place in the AL West"></a>Bitcoin Jobbing Athletics Secure Second Place in the AL West</h1><p>The Bitcoin Jobbing Athletics managed to snag second place in the AL West, despite having a relatively young and inexperienced squad. Led by MVP candidate Mike Trout, the Jobbing Athletics put up a strong fight against the more established teams in their division.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Jobbing Athletics Highlights</p>
<p>-Mike Trout led all of baseball in both batting average and on-base percentage. His stellar play helped carry the team through some tough stretches.</p>
<p>-While the starting rotation was inconsistent at times, there were some bright spots. Edwin Jackson, acquired in a midseason trade, proved to be a valuable addition to the rotation. He posted an impressive 3.32 ERA in his 13 starts with the Jobbing Athletics.</p>
<p>-The bullpen was one of the team’s strengths. Led by closer Sean Doolittle, they were among the league leaders in both ERA (3.02) and strikeouts (481).</p>
<p>What Went Wrong</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The starting rotation was plagued by inconsistency all season long. Only three starters (Trevor Cahill, Garrett Richards, and Jesse Chavez) managed to post an ERA under 4.00.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team struggled to score runs early in the season. They averaged just 3.5 runs per game in April and May combined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Bitcoin-Keeps-Athletics-in-the-Game-With-Win-Over-Mariners"><a href="#Bitcoin-Keeps-Athletics-in-the-Game-With-Win-Over-Mariners" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin Keeps Athletics in the Game With Win Over Mariners"></a>Bitcoin Keeps Athletics in the Game With Win Over Mariners</h1><p>The Seattle Mariners hosted the San Diego Padres at Safeco Field on Sunday, April 15th. Unfortunately for them, they couldn’t muster up enough offense to come away with a win. In the top of the 9th inning, Padres outfielder Hunter Renfroe hit a 2-run home run off Mariners relief pitcher Emilio Pagan to give his team the lead and eventual victory.</p>
<p>Bitcoin had an interesting role in this game. The digital asset was used to purchase tickets for two fans in attendance. One of those fans happened to be sitting in the Bitcoin seats, which are located in section 134 of Safeco Field. This was only the second time that Bitcoin has been used to purchase tickets for a sporting event, with the first taking place at a UFC match last year.</p>
<p>The use of Bitcoin as a means of purchasing tickets is part of a growing trend that is seeing more and more sporting organizations accept the digital asset as a form of payment. The Sacramento Kings became the first professional sports team to accept Bitcoin in 2014, and they have been followed by teams like the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Philadelphia 76ers. Many colleges and universities around the country have also started accepting Bitcoin for ticket payments and other related transactions.</p>
<p>The use of Bitcoin as a form of payment for sporting events makes sense when you consider some of the benefits that it offers. For one, Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used anywhere in the world. This eliminates any potential issues with foreign currencies and allows fans from all over to participate in online ticket sales.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is also much faster and cheaper than traditional forms of payment like credit cards or bank transfers. This can be especially helpful when it comes to purchasing tickets last minute or when large orders need to be processed quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, using Bitcoin helps reduce costs for both the team and the fan. By cutting out credit card fees and other associated costs, teams can save money on ticket sales while fans can avoid paying additional charges that can add up quickly.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s clear that Bitcoin has a lot to offer when it comes to supporting athletic organizations around the world. With its fast speeds, global reach, and low costs, Bitcoin is helping make it easier than ever for fans to support their favorite teams.</p>
