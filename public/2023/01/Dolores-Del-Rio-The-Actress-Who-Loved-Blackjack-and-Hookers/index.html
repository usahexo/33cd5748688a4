            <h1 id="Dolores-Del-Rio-The-Actress-Who-Loved-Blackjack-and-Hookers"><a href="#Dolores-Del-Rio-The-Actress-Who-Loved-Blackjack-and-Hookers" class="headerlink" title="Dolores Del Rio: The Actress Who Loved Blackjack and Hookers"></a>Dolores Del Rio: The Actress Who Loved Blackjack and Hookers</h1><p>Dolores Del Rio was a beautiful actress who starred in many Hollywood films during the 1920s and 1930s. She quickly became one of the highest-paid and most popular stars in America, but she was also known for her vices. Dolores loved blackjack and hookers, and she was often spotted at casinos and brothels.</p>
<p>Dolores was born on August 3, 1905, in San Francisco, California. Her father was a Mexican diplomat, and her mother was from a wealthy Spanish family. Dolores had a privileged upbringing and spent her childhood traveling around the world. When she was 17, she moved to New York City to attend drama school.</p>
<p>In 1924, Dolores made her Broadway debut in the play “Ramona.” The following year, she made her feature film debut in “Her Reputation.” Dolores quickly became one of Hollywood’s most sought-after actresses, starring in films such as “What Price Glory?” (1926), “The Littlest Rebel” (1935), and “The Devil Is a Woman” (1936).</p>
<p>Despite her success, Dolores was known for her wild lifestyle. She loved gambling and often lost large sums of money at blackjack tables. She was also a regular at brothels, where she would enjoy sex with prostitutes. In fact, when MGM conducted screen tests for its new starlets in 1935, one of the questions they asked each girl was: “What do you think of Mrs. Del Rio’s morals?”</p>
<p>Dolores’ wild lifestyle caused many problems with her marriages. In 1926, she married actor Reggie REad; however, the marriage ended in divorce just two years later. She then married actor Lew Ayres; but that marriage also ended in divorce after just four years. In 1940, Dolores married Orson Welles; but that marriage lasted just four months.</p>
<p>Despite her personal troubles, Dolores continued to be one of Hollywood’s top stars throughout the 1930s. She retired from acting in 1947 and moved to Mexico City. There she started a successful career as a television producer. Dolores died from lung cancer on September 11, 1983, at the age of 78.</p>

Her father, a bullfighter, and her mother, a dancer, had immigrated to Mexico from Spain. From an early age Margarita showed a talent for dance and soon began performing with her parents in theaters and clubs throughout Mexico.</p>
<p>When Margarita was 17 years old her family relocated to Los Angeles, California.

<p>In 1925 Del Rio married singer Tony Martin; the marriage only lasted a year. The couple had one daughter, also named Dolores.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s Del Rio appeared in a series of successful Hollywood films including “Flying Down to Rio” (1933), “Our Dancing Daughters” (1928), and “What Price Hollywood?” (1932). She also began appearing in nightclubs throughout the country where she became known for her flamboyant lifestyle and her ability to playing blackjack and hookers.</p>
<p>It was during this time that Del Rio also began a close friendship with actress Marlene Dietrich which would last for many years. Dietrich once said of Del Rio, “She is certainly the most beautiful woman I have ever seen - inside and out. She has my complete admiration.”</p>
<p>By the early 1940s Del Rio’s popularity had begun to decline and she made only a few more films before retiring from show business in 1945. She moved to New York City where she lived until her death in 1983.</p>
<p>Although she never won an Academy Award, Del Rio was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. She is also remembered as one of Hollywood’s earliest sex symbols and one of its most glamorous actresses of her era.</p>
