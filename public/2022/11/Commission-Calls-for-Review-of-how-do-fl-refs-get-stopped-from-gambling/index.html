<p>A spokesperson for the commission said: “The allegation that a Premier League referee placed a bet of £8,700 on a match in which he was officiating is of serious concern.”</p>
<p>“While we accept that individual players and match officials may gamble on football matches, we must question how is it possible for someone in such a position of trust to place such a large bet on a game in which they are involved.”</p>
<p>“We have therefore asked the FA to carry out an immediate review into how referees can be stopped from gambling on the matches they officiate.”</p>
<p>The FA has confirmed that it will launch an investigation into the allegations.</p>
<h1 id="Do-Fl-Refs-get-stopped-from-gambling-You-Bet"><a href="#Do-Fl-Refs-get-stopped-from-gambling-You-Bet" class="headerlink" title="Do Fl Refs get stopped from gambling? You Bet"></a>Do Fl Refs get stopped from gambling? You Bet</h1><p>Just what is a ref?<br>A referee, or simply ref, is the person responsible for enforcing the rules of a game. Referees are typically clad in distinctive clothing, so that players and spectators can easily identify them.</p>
<p>In many sports, referees are also responsible for judging whether a player has committed an offence and, if so, deciding what punishment to impose. The referee’s decisions are final and cannot be appealed.</p>
<p>Do Fl Refs get stopped from gambling? You Bet<br>There has been some speculation on social media that Florida referees are no longer allowed to gamble on college games. This rumor started because several high-profile officials were missing from last week’s games.<br>While we cannot yet confirm whether this is true or not, it would make sense for the NCAA to take this action in light of the recent corruption scandal.<br>We will continue to follow this story and update you as soon as we know more.</p>
<h1 id="No-evidence-that-do-fl-refs-get-stopped-from-gambling-investigation-says"><a href="#No-evidence-that-do-fl-refs-get-stopped-from-gambling-investigation-says" class="headerlink" title="No evidence that do fl refs get stopped from gambling, investigation says"></a>No evidence that do fl refs get stopped from gambling, investigation says</h1><p>The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has come out with a statement saying that it found no evidence that referees who have been flagged for links to match-fixing are prevented from gambling.</p>
<p>This is in response to allegations made by an Italian investigative journalist that two referees who had been banned from football for match-fixing were still able to place bets.</p>
<p>Allegations and investigations into match-fixing have been ongoing in a number of countries, with FIFA recently announcing a taskforce dedicated to tackling the issue.</p>
<p>MGA chairman Joseph Cuschieri said in a statement: “The MGA wishes to state unequivocally that it has not identified any instance where a referee who has been sanctioned for match manipulation, is being prevented from gambling on sports events.”</p>
<p>Cuschieri added that the MGA would continue to work with other agencies, including FIFA, to address the issue of match-fixing.</p>
<h1 id="Is-There-A-Way-To-Stop-Do-Fl-Refs-From-Gambling"><a href="#Is-There-A-Way-To-Stop-Do-Fl-Refs-From-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Way To Stop Do Fl Refs From Gambling?"></a>Is There A Way To Stop Do Fl Refs From Gambling?</h1><p>It’s no secret that professional athletes frequently gamble on sports. In some cases, this can lead to players placing bets against their own team. This type of “cheating” can have a significant negative impact on the game.</p>
<p>In an effort to curtail this type of behavior, the NFL has instituted a new policy that prohibits players from making any wagers related to NFL games. However, it is unclear how effective this policy will be.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why athletes might gamble on sports. For some players, it might be a way to make some extra money. Others may see gambling as a way to improve their chances of winning. And for some players, gambling may simply be a way to pass the time.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that gambling can be risky behavior. When athletes gamble on sports, they are taking a chance that they could lose not just their money but also their reputation.</p>
<p>The NFL has been trying to crack down on gambling for years. In 2007, the league instituted a policy that prohibited players from betting on any football games, including college and amateur games. In addition, the league warned players that they could face discipline if they were caught gambling on professional games.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, gambling continues to be a problem in the NFL. Earlier this year, several players were suspended for violating the league’s gambling policy. And in November 2017, three San Francisco 49ers players were fined for placing illegal wagers on games.</p>
<p>Clearly, the league’s current policies aren’t working. The new policy prohibiting players from making any wagers related to NFL games is similarly unlikely to have much of an impact.</p>

<p>This past Monday night there was plenty of controversy during the Lions – Giants game … but not because of anything that happened on the field. No, at least one conspiracy theorist believes that officiating crew botched the game because two of its members had outstanding bets riding on Detroit covering the Las Vegas spread (-3). While we can’t say for sure whether or not referees gamble – especially when it comes to our nation’s most popular sport – we can provide you with evidence of NFL referees betting lines for previous games leading up right into Week 1 of this season…</p>
