            <h1 id="New-York-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-by-End-of-Year"><a href="#New-York-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-by-End-of-Year" class="headerlink" title="New York Poised to Legalize Sports Betting by End of Year"></a>New York Poised to Legalize Sports Betting by End of Year</h1><p>On Monday, November 26th, New York lawmakers reached an agreement to legalize sports betting before the end of the year. The proposed bill would allow for both in-person and online betting at licensed casinos throughout the state.</p>
<p>“It is time for New York to join the rest of the country in allowing its citizens to bet on sporting events,” said Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, a sponsor of the bill.</p>
<p>The agreement still needs to be approved by both the Assembly and Senate, but it is expected to pass as both chambers are controlled by Democrats. Governor Andrew Cuomo has already voiced his support for the measure.</p>
<p>If passed, New York would become the seventh state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned a ban on the activity in May. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Rhode Island all allow some form of sports betting.</p>
<p>While details are still being finalized, it is expected that New York’s sports betting law will be similar to those in other states. Gamblers would be able to place bets on professional and college sports games at licensed casinos or online through one of the state’s approved operators.</p>
<p>Opinion is divided on whether or not legalized sports betting is a good thing. Proponents argue that it will generate new revenue for the state and create jobs. Opponents worry that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other social problems.</p>
<p>No matter where you stand on the issue, there is no doubt that legalizing sports betting will have a significant impact on New York’s economy. With seven states now allowing it and more likely to follow suit, this is a rapidly-growing industry that businesses in New York should pay attention to.</p>
<h1 id="Cuomo-Vows-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-by-End-of-Year"><a href="#Cuomo-Vows-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-by-End-of-Year" class="headerlink" title="Cuomo Vows to Legalize Sports Betting by End of Year"></a>Cuomo Vows to Legalize Sports Betting by End of Year</h1><p>Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has vowed to legalize sports betting by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Cuomo believes that legalizing sports betting will help to stimulate the state economy and bring in new tax revenue. The governor is also hoping that the legalization of sports betting will help to combat illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>“The illegal gambling industry is a multibillion-dollar economic engine that deprives government of revenues, cheats consumers and employs organized crime,” said Cuomo in a statement. “It’s time to get this mafia activity out of our communities and allow New Yorkers to benefit from this popular pastime.”</p>
<p>Cuomo isn’t alone in his belief that legalizing sports betting can be beneficial for the economy. A recent study by Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, LLC showed that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $216 million in annual tax revenue across the United States.</p>
<p>Not everyone is on board with legalizing sports betting, however. Some gaming experts warn that the legalization of sports betting could lead to an increase in addiction rates and other social problems.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Set-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Time-for-Football-Season"><a href="#New-York-Set-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Time-for-Football-Season" class="headerlink" title="New York Set to Legalize Sports Betting in Time for Football Season"></a>New York Set to Legalize Sports Betting in Time for Football Season</h1><p>On Wednesday, New York lawmakers passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill now goes to Governor Andrew Cuomo for his signature. If he signs it, residents will be able to place bets on NFL and college football games starting in time for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>New York is one of several states that have been considering legalizing sports betting in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision last year to strike down a federal ban on the practice. Eleven states have already taken action, and more are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>The New York bill was sponsored by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, who said that legalizing sports betting would bring in new revenue for the state. “It’s not just about gambling,” he said. “It’s also about tax revenue.”</p>
<p>The bill allows casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, and it imposes a tax of 10 percent on bets placed at casinos and 5 percent on bets placed at racetracks. The legislation also calls for a 1 percent integrity fee to be paid to the leagues on bets placed on their games.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. But Pretlow said that such concerns can be addressed with regulations. “We can put restrictions on it,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a>“ he said. “We can make sure people are not becoming addicted.”</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo has not said whether he will sign the bill, but he has indicated that he is open to the idea of legalizing sports betting. “I’ll look at the legislation,” he said, “but I’m inclined to do it.”</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Early-2019"><a href="#New-York-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Early-2019" class="headerlink" title="New York Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in Early 2019"></a>New York Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in Early 2019</h1><p>The New York state legislature is on the verge of legalizing sports betting, with the bill expected to be passed in early 2019. This would make New York the fourth state in the US to legalize sports betting, after Delaware, West Virginia, and Mississippi.</p>
<p>The bill would allow licensed casinos and racetracks in New York to offer sports betting, with online and mobile betting also available. The legislation would impose a 10 percent tax on sports betting revenue, which is expected to bring in $18 million per year.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will help generate revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and other social problems. However, most experts believe that legalization of sports betting will be a net positive for states and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>New Jersey was the first state to legalize sports betting following the US Supreme Court’s decision in May 2018 to strike down a federal ban on such activities. Since then, three other states have followed suit, with more likely to do so in the near future.</p>
<p>This trend is being driven by changing public attitudes towards gambling, as well as the growing popularity of legal online gambling sites. Many people see sports betting as simply another form of entertainment, similar to watching games on TV or going to a casino.</p>
<p>There are already numerous illegal online sports betting operations, so it makes sense for states to legalize and regulate this activity. By doing so, they can ensure that consumers are protected while also generating some much-needed revenue.</p>
<h1 id="State-Legislature-Approves-Bill-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-New-York"><a href="#State-Legislature-Approves-Bill-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="State Legislature Approves Bill to Legalize Sports Betting in New York"></a>State Legislature Approves Bill to Legalize Sports Betting in New York</h1><p>In a unanimous vote by the New York State Legislature, a bill to legalize sports betting in the state was approved on Wednesday. The measure now goes to Governor Andrew Cuomo for his signature.</p>
<p>“It is time for New York to join the rest of the country and legalize sports betting,” said Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, a sponsor of the bill.</p>
<p>Under the proposed law, the New York State Gaming Commission would be responsible for regulating sports betting, which would be available at casinos and racetracks in the state. The bill would also allow bets to be placed online and through mobile devices.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo has not indicated whether he will sign the bill into law. In a statement, he said that he will review it carefully before making a decision.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalizing sports betting say that it would bring additional revenue to the state, while opponents argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills.</p>
