            <h1 id="Do-you-think-Casino-Days-will-enjoy-a-solid-season-in-the-Bundesliga-under-new-manager-Ralf-Rangnick"><a href="#Do-you-think-Casino-Days-will-enjoy-a-solid-season-in-the-Bundesliga-under-new-manager-Ralf-Rangnick" class="headerlink" title="Do you think Casino Days will enjoy a solid season in the Bundesliga under new manager Ralf Rangnick?"></a>Do you think Casino Days will enjoy a solid season in the Bundesliga under new manager Ralf Rangnick?</h1><p>German side Casino Days have enjoyed a revival in fortunes since hiring Ralf Rangnick as manager last season. The former Schalke 04 and Red Bull Leipzig boss has led the club to their best Bundesliga finish in recent memory, qualifying for European football in the process.</p>
<p>This season promises to be even better for Casino Days, with the arrivals of some top-quality players including £60m-rated midfielder Julian Brandt and Spanish forward Paco Alcacer. Both players should help to fire Casino Days to success in the Bundesliga and beyond.</p>
<p>Rangnick is a vastly experienced manager who knows how to get the best out of his players. He has a clear tactical vision and is not afraid to make tough decisions when necessary. This gives his teams a fighting chance against the best opposition.</p>
<p>Casino Days fans will be hoping that their team can mount a serious title challenge this season and finally end their long wait for championship glory. With Rangnick at the helm, there is a real chance of this happening.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Leipzig-be-able-to-challenge-for-a-Champions-League-spot"><a href="#Will-Leipzig-be-able-to-challenge-for-a-Champions-League-spot" class="headerlink" title="Will Leipzig be able to challenge for a Champions League spot?"></a>Will Leipzig be able to challenge for a Champions League spot?</h1><p>Leipzig reached the Bundesliga in 2016 and completed their first ever season in the top flight of German football. Finishing 2nd in the Bundesliga, they achieved Champions League qualification, losing to eventual semi-finalists Monaco in the playoffs. This season they will be looking to improve on last year and make a real challenge for the title.</p>
<p> Ralph Hasenhüttl has been in charge at Leipzig since 2016 and his tactics of high-pressing and intense attacking football have seen the club grow into one of Europe’s most exciting young sides. The likes of Timo Werner, Emil Forsberg and Naby Keita have all been nurtured by Hasenhüttl and are now starting to make an impact on the world stage.</p>
<p>With a team that’s growing in confidence each season, it’s no wonder that many are predicting a successful campaign from Leipzig this time around. Their main rivals for a Champions League spot are likely to be Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and Hoffenheim but with everything to play for, it’s sure to be an exciting battle until the end.</p>
<h1 id="Do-you-think-Tomas-Rosicky-can-help-fill-the-void-left-by-Naby-Keita’s-departure"><a href="#Do-you-think-Tomas-Rosicky-can-help-fill-the-void-left-by-Naby-Keita’s-departure" class="headerlink" title="Do you think Tomas Rosicky can help fill the void left by Naby Keita’s departure?"></a>Do you think Tomas Rosicky can help fill the void left by Naby Keita’s departure?</h1><p>The £48M departure of Naby Keita to Liverpool has left a big void in RB Leipzig’s midfield. This is a void that Tomas Rosicky, 37, can help fill.</p>
<p>Rosicky began his career at Sparta Prague before moving to Borussia Dortmund in 2001. He moved to Arsenal in 2006, where he spent 10 years of his career. He then had brief spells at Spartak Moscow and Benfica before joining RB Leipzig in January 2018.</p>
<p>Rosicky has a lot of Bundesliga experience, having played for both Dortmund and Arsenal in the German top flight. He also knows what it takes to win the Bundesliga, as he won the title with Dortmund in 2002.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig will be looking for another strong season following their disappointng 2nd place last time around. They lost some key players in Keita and winger Emil Forsberg (to AS Roma), but they’ve brought in experienced signings like Rosicky and striker Jean-Kevin Augustin (from Paris Saint-Germain).</p>
<p>Augustin is likely to replace Forsberg as RB Leipzig’s main creative outlet this season. But with Rosicky playing alongside him, Augustin should have more space and time on the ball to create chances for himself and his teammates.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig manager Ralf Rangnick has praised Rosicky’s professionalism and attitude since joining the club: “Tomas is a very experienced player who can help us with his attitude and knowledge of the game.”</p>
<p>It looks like Rosicky could be an important player for RB Leipzig this season as they look to challenge Bayern Munich for the Bundesliga title.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-you-make-of-RB-Leipzig’s-signing-of-Timo-Werner-from-Stuttgart"><a href="#What-do-you-make-of-RB-Leipzig’s-signing-of-Timo-Werner-from-Stuttgart" class="headerlink" title="What do you make of RB Leipzig’s signing of Timo Werner from Stuttgart?"></a>What do you make of RB Leipzig’s signing of Timo Werner from Stuttgart?</h1><p>The signing of Timo Werner from Stuttgart by RB Leipzig has surprised many observers. The fee of €10 million is reported to be a club record for the Bundesliga new boys, and Werner is seen as one of the most promising young players in German football.</p>
<p>Werner burst onto the scene last season with 15 goals in 33 appearances for Stuttgart, and at just 20 years old he looks like a player with a bright future. His pace and energy make him ideally suited to the RB Leipzig style of play, and he should be able to help the team build on their impressive debut season in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Leipzig finished sixth in the Bundesliga last season, qualifying for the Europa League. They will be hoping to improve on that this season, and with Werner now on board they have a real chance of doing so.</p>
<h1 id="Is-there-any-danger-of-RB-Leipzig’s-rapid-ascent-leading-to-a-fall-from-grace"><a href="#Is-there-any-danger-of-RB-Leipzig’s-rapid-ascent-leading-to-a-fall-from-grace" class="headerlink" title="Is there any danger of RB Leipzig’s rapid ascent leading to a fall from grace?"></a>Is there any danger of RB Leipzig’s rapid ascent leading to a fall from grace?</h1><p>Few teams have made quite as swift a rise through the German footballing pyramid as RB Leipzig. The club was only founded in 2009, and yet they are now playing in the Bundesliga, having won promotion in 2016.</p>
<p>Many pundits have suggested that RB Leipzig’s meteoric ascent could lead to a fall from grace, but is this really likely to happen?</p>
<p>RB Leipzig have been financially backed by energy drink manufacturer Red Bull, which has allowed them to invest heavily in their playing squad. This has led some observers to suggest that the club are not a genuine footballing institution, but rather are a “moneyball” team whose success is based purely on financial muscle.</p>
<p>However, RB Leipzig have proved that they are more than just a one-trick pony by achieving promotion to the Bundesliga on merit. The club finished second in the 2. Bundesliga last season, and this was largely down to the goalscoring exploits of Davie Selke.</p>
<p>Selke has since left RB Leipzig for Hertha Berlin, but the club have replaced him with young Belgian striker Timo Werner, who scored 22 goals in the Bundesliga last season with VfB Stuttgart.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig also have an extremely talented squad of players, and this was evident in their recent pre-season friendly against Premier League side Liverpool. The Bundesliga newcomers caused an upset by beating Liverpool 4-1 thanks to goals from new signings Naby Keita and Emil Forsberg.</p>
<p>It is clear that RB Leipzig are a team on the rise, and there is no danger of them falling from grace any time soon.</p>
